; An LR (short for launching rocket) is one of:
; – "resting"

; interpretation "resting" represents a grounded rocket
; a number denotes the height of a rocket in flight

; An LRCD (for launching rocket countdown) is one of:
; – "resting"
; – a Number between -3 and -1
; – a NonnegativeNumber 
; interpretation a grounded rocket, in countdown mode,
; a number denotes the number of pixels between the
; top of the canvas and the rocket (its height)

; Exercise 55

; Exercise 54
; The use of string=? casts a too narrow net because any string should be a resting state.
; If al strings weren't interpreted as resting a stray string could cause a bug by trying to compare
; x as string to other numbers in the other two conditionals
